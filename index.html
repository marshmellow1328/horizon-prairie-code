          ## Global Company

          ## Principal's IT Model
          * Federated Model
            * Each business line has their own IT staff
            * Corporate shared services
              * We work in this area
          * Business Units have autonomy



          ## Where We Were
          ![pfg themes architecture](images/pfg-themes.png)



          ## Our Drivers
          * Moving to an unified global brand
          * New technologies to support (e.g. Drupal (PHP), .NET, etc.)



          ## Industry Trends
          ![industry model](images/industry-bootstrap.png)



          ## What We Wanted
          * Enterprise framework
          * Allow sites to provide unique needs

          ![principal model](images/industry-preferred.png)



          ## The Answer - Horizon
          * Horizon is our proprietary UI library designed to make implementing Principal applications and site easier



          ## What is Horizon made up of?
          * Core
          * Theme Services
          * Add-ons



          ## Horizon Core
          * Consists of _one_ css and _one_ js file
          * Dependencies are baked in
            * Developers do not need to download jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome etc.



          ## Horizon Theme Services
          * Header and footer REST service to syndicate HTML
          * TODO: INSERT PICTURE



          ## Horizon Add-ons
          * 80/20 Rule
          * Extras an app can add as needed
          * Distributed as separate assets
          * Receive the same level of support as core



          ## How did we do it?
          First let's start with the decisions
          * "Internal Open Source"
          * Version strategy
          * Caching
          * Bundled dependencies
          * Build process
          * Consumption pattern(s)



          ### What we decided
          * Internal Open Source
            * Anyone can submit PRs
            * Publish release notes internally
              * Call out key changes and list tickets resolved
              * Strictly adhere to semantic versioning
          * Version strategy - Use semantic versioning
          * Caching - Host on CDN with 8hr cache
          * Bundled dependencies - Prevent issues from mismatched versions, multiple HTTP requests
          * Build process - Built a new one from scratch. Fully automated
          * Consumption pattern(s) - Support CDN and npm
            * Highly recommend using the CDN unless they have a valid business case



          ### Did we get it right?
          * Not out of the gate, but that's okay!
          * It was an evolution
            * v0 had 11 minor releases
            * v1 had 30 minor releases
            * v2 has 11 minor releases



          ## Transition Challenges
          * Managing what gets approved for core
          * Determining what application needs are unique
          * Build a culture of OSS and getting people to contribute
          * Moving to explicit versions
            * That means consumers have to upgrade
            * Requires developers to be more strategic with breaking changes
          * Documentation
