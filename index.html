          # Re-Architecting the Frontend at Scale

          Shawn Sparks and Thomas Lindner



          ## Principal
          * Founded in 1879. Innovating at 137!
          * Financial Services
            * Retirement, Investments, Insurance
            * We help you live your best life
          * Global, 17 countries

          ## Global Company

          ## Principal's IT Model
          * Federated Model
            * Each business line has their own IT staff
            * Corporate shared services
          * BUs have autonomy



          ## Where We Were
          * Theme solution tied to specific technologies (i.e. jsp, jsf)

          ![pfg themes architecture](images/pfg-themes.png)



          ## What was driving us

          ### Industry Trends
          Don't like how similar this picture is to last slide. Not intentional
          ![industry model](images/industry-bootstrap.png)


          ### Upcoming roadmap
          * Moving to an unified global brand
          * New technologies to support (i.e. Drupal (PHP), .NET, etc.)



          ## What We Wanted
          * Enterprise framework
          * Allow sites to provide unique needs

          ![principal model](images/industry-preferred.png)



          ## The Answer

          ### Horizon

          * Horizon is a frontend framework designed to make implementing Principal applications and site easier


          ## Horizon
          * Consists of _one_ css and _one_ js file
          * Everything is baked in
            * Developers do not need to download jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome etc.


          ## Horizon
          * Header and footer REST service to syndicate HTML
          * TODO: INSERT PICTURE



          ## How did we do it?
          First let's start with the decisions

          ### Key decisions
          * Caching
          * Version strategy
          * Bundled dependencies
          * Services (theme service)
          * Build process
          * Consumption pattern(s)
          * What is included


          ### What we decided
          * Caching - Host on CDN with 8hr cache
          * Version strategy - Use semantic versioning
          * Bundled dependencies - Tools that help 80% of our apps
          * Services - Header/footer service
          * Build process - Built a new one from scratch. Fully automated
          * Consumption pattern(s) - Support CDN and npm
            * Highly recommend using the CDN unless they have a valid business case
          * What is included - That's a longer story :)


          ### Did we get it right?
          * Not out of the gate, but that's okay!
          * It was an evolution
            * v0 had 11 minor releases
            * v1 had 30 minor releases
            * v2 has 11 minor releases
          * Publish release notes internally
            * Approached as internal OSS
            * Call out key changes and list tickets resolved
            * Strictly adhere to semantic versioning


          ### Back to what is included
          * We added a number of components in v1
          * v2 saw some of them removed
          * Launched Horizon Add-ons to provide the same support
            * Add-ons receive the same level of support as core
            * Hosted on the CDN
            * Distributed as separate assets



          ## Transition Challenges
          * Managing what gets approved for core
          * Determining what application needs are unique
          * Build a culture of OSS and getting people to contribute
          * Moving to explicit versions
            * That means consumers have to upgrade
            * Requires developers to be more strategic with breaking changes
          * Documentation
